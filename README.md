Portfolio showcasing how I would propose a business solution
My team and I were recognized as a semi-finalists in the annual SOA Student Case Study Challenge. This challenge is a global competition that takes place over the course of 8 weeks.
The 2018 challenge was assessing the sustainability and making recommendations on a country's social Long-Term Care program.
My team and I developed a model that forecasted a variety of factors such as population growth and development, income levels and distribution, administrative expenses, care expenses, and percent of population in need of different types of LTC.
Lastly, we submitted a written report of our findings and conclusions.
